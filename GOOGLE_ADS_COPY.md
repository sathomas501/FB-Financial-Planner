## Ad Copy Best Practices

### Message Match Rules:
1. **First headline** should match the landing page H1 exactly or very closely
2. **Description 1** should match the landing page opening paragraph
3. **Keywords in ad** should appear in the landing page within first screen
4. **CTA in ad** (Download, Try Free, Buy) should match CTA on landing page

### Testing Strategy:
1. **Start with 3-5 headlines** and 2 descriptions active per ad group
2. **Let Google optimize** for 2-4 weeks with "Optimize" setting
3. **Review performance** monthly - pause lowest performers, add new variants
4. **Test different value props:**
   - Price-focused ("$149 One-Time vs $10K/Year")
   - Feature-focused ("Monte Carlo + Tax Modeling")
   - Urgency-focused ("TCJA Expires Dec 31, 2025")
   - Authority-focused ("Professional Planning Tools")

### Quality Score Optimization:
- **Expected CTR:** Use compelling headlines with numbers and specifics
- **Ad Relevance:** Match keywords exactly in headlines
- **Landing Page Experience:** Fast load, mobile-friendly, clear CTA
- **Message Match:** Ad promise = landing page delivery

---

## Campaign Settings Recommendations

### Bidding Strategy:
**Start:** Manual CPC with Enhanced CPC
- Set max CPC: $3-5 for download keywords, $8-12 for high-intent purchase keywords
- Monitor for 2-4 weeks, gather conversion data

**After 30+ Conversions:** Switch to Target CPA
- Set target CPA around $30-50 for `download_app`
- Set target ROAS for `purchase` if you have revenue data

### Ad Rotation:
**Use:** Optimize (Google's recommendation)
- Google will show best-performing ad combinations
- Requires less manual testing

### Audience Targeting (Observation Mode):
Add these audiences to observe performance:
- In-market: Retirement Planning
- Affinity: Investment & Financial Planning Enthusiasts
- Demographics: 45-65 years old, HHI $100k+

### Geographic Targeting:
**Start broad:** United States
**Later refine:** Exclude low-performing states or focus on high-income areas

---

## Tracking & Measurement

### Primary Conversion: `download_app`
- **Goal:** 50+ downloads per month
- **Target CPA:** $30-50
- **Measure:** Download rate, activation rate (do they actually use it)

### Secondary Conversion: `purchase`
- **Goal:** 5-10 purchases per month
- **Target ROAS:** 3:1 minimum ($149 revenue / $50 ad spend)
- **Measure:** Conversion rate from download → purchase

### Assisted Conversions:
Track `begin_checkout` to understand:
- How many people click to Stripe but don't complete?
- Which ads drive consideration vs conversion?
- Time lag between click and purchase

---

## Budget Recommendations

### Starting Budget:
**Total:** $1,500 - $3,000/month
**Allocation:**
- Roth Conversion campaign: $800/month (40%)
- TCJA/Tax Law campaign: $600/month (30%)
- Advisor Alternative campaign: $600/month (30%)

### Expected Results (Conservative):
- **CTR:** 3-5%
- **Conversion Rate (Download):** 10-20%
- **Cost per Download:** $30-60
- **Downloads per Month:** 50-100
- **Download → Purchase Rate:** 5-10%
- **Purchases per Month:** 5-10

**ROI Calculation:**
- Spend: $3,000/month
- Downloads: 75 (at $40 CPA)
- Purchases: 5 (at 7% conversion rate)
- Revenue: $745 (5 × $149)
- **First Month ROAS:** 0.25:1 (negative - expected)
- **Lifetime Value:** Each free user is potential future Pro customer

### Scale After Validation:
Once you hit target CPAs and have positive ROAS:
- Increase budget 20% per month
- Expand to more keywords
- Test additional ad copy variants
- Add remarketing campaigns
