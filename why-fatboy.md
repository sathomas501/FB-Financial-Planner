# Why Fatboy Financial Planner?

**Tax laws change. Your retirement calculator shouldn't be stuck in 2024.**

The TCJA→OBBBA transition just proved exactly why Fatboy's approach matters. Here's what happened:

## The TCJA Expiration Panic (2024)

**December 2024:**
- Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) set to expire December 31, 2025
- Tax rates would increase from 22% to 25%, 24% to 28%
- Standard deduction would drop from $29,200 to $15,000
- Retirement planners panicked: "Should we convert to Roth now?"

**Most retirement software:** Hardcoded with 2024 tax rates. No way to model the expiration. Vendors promised updates "coming soon."

**Fatboy users:** Edited tax parameters to model both scenarios. Saw exactly what TCJA expiration would cost. Made informed decisions about 2025 Roth conversions.

## The OBBBA Surprise (July 2025)

**July 4, 2025:**
- One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) passes
- TCJA brackets made PERMANENT (22% and 24% stay)
- NEW $6,000 senior deduction added (2026-2028 only)
- Estate tax exemption increased to $15M
- TSP to Roth TSP conversions now allowed

**This wasn't the TCJA expiration everyone modeled. This was something different.**

**Most retirement software:** Obsolete overnight. Still showing TCJA expiration scenarios. Waiting for vendor updates to add senior deduction. Users stuck with wrong numbers.

**Fatboy users:** Updated tax parameters themselves within hours. Modeled the new senior deduction. Ran 2026-2028 conversion scenarios immediately. Kept planning while everyone else waited.

## What This Proves

**Tax law changes are not hypothetical. They're constant.**

In the last 20 years:
- 2001: EGTRRA passed (Bush tax cuts)
- 2003: JGTRRA passed (capital gains changes)
- 2010: Tax Relief Act (estate tax changes)
- 2012: ATRA passed (fiscal cliff resolution)
- 2017: TCJA passed (major overhaul)
- 2025: OBBBA passed (TCJA extension + new provisions)

**That's a major tax law change every 3-4 years.**

**And every time, hardcoded retirement calculators become obsolete for 6-18 months while vendors scramble to update.**

## The Hardcoded Software Problem

Most retirement planning tools work like this:

1. Vendor hardcodes 2024 tax rates into software
2. User runs retirement projections (assuming 2024 rates forever)
3. Tax law changes
4. **Software is now wrong**
5. User waits 6-18 months for vendor update
6. Vendor finally updates (maybe)
7. Repeat when next tax law changes

**Problems with this approach:**

**❌ You're planning with outdated assumptions**
Your 2027 retirement plan assumes 2024 tax rates that don't exist anymore.

**❌ You can't model "what if" scenarios**
What if Congress changes tax rates in 2027? You have no way to model it.

**❌ You're dependent on vendor updates**
Your $100/year subscription gets you... waiting for updates.

**❌ Your plan is always 1-2 years behind current law**
By the time software updates, the law has changed again.

## The Fatboy Approach

Fatboy works differently:

1. **Tax parameters are editable by you**
   - Tax brackets (by year)
   - Standard deduction (by year)
   - Personal exemptions (toggle on/off)
   - IRMAA thresholds
   - RMD age requirements
   - All major tax parameters

2. **You model scenarios yourself**
   - Scenario A: Current law continues
   - Scenario B: TCJA expires as scheduled
   - Scenario C: OBBBA passes (what actually happened)
   - Scenario D: Future changes you anticipate

3. **You update immediately when laws change**
   - OBBBA passes July 4, 2025
   - You read the law (or our blog)
   - You update tax parameters
   - You're modeling accurately within hours

4. **You're never dependent on vendor updates**
   - No waiting 6-18 months
   - No being stuck with wrong numbers
   - No hoping the vendor eventually updates

## Real Example: OBBBA Senior Deduction

**The OBBBA senior deduction is temporary (2026-2028 only).**

This creates a critical 3-year window for Roth conversions where:
- You get an extra $6,000-$12,000 deduction
- Conversions are 10-20% cheaper than in 2029+
- Strategic timing can save $3,000-$10,000 in taxes

**Most retirement calculators:**
- Don't have senior deduction coded yet (as of January 2026)
- When they add it, might not code the 2028 sunset correctly
- Might show senior deduction forever (wrong)
- Or might not show it at all (also wrong)
- **Users making $100,000+ decisions based on wrong math**

**Fatboy approach:**
- Edit standard deduction for 2026-2028: Add $12,000 (senior deduction)
- Edit standard deduction for 2029+: Back to $31,500 (senior deduction expired)
- Run Roth conversion scenarios comparing 2026-2028 vs 2029+
- See exactly how much the senior deduction saves
- Make informed decisions about conversion timing

**Same-day accuracy. No vendor update required.**

## What Happens When the Next Tax Law Changes?

**Because it will. Probably in 2027-2028.**

Possible changes on the horizon:
- OBBBA senior deduction expires 2028 (guaranteed)
- Social Security funding crisis (2034 trust fund depletion)
- Capital gains rate changes (frequently proposed)
- IRMAA bracket adjustments (happens constantly)
- RMD age increases (changed twice in 5 years)
- Estate tax exemption changes (political football)

**With hardcoded software:**
You're stuck until vendor updates. Months of planning paralysis.

**With Fatboy:**
You edit the parameters yourself. Keep planning through the uncertainty.

## "But I Don't Know What Future Tax Rates Will Be"

**Neither do we. Neither does anyone.**

That's exactly why you need scenario modeling, not hardcoded assumptions.

**Example: TCJA Expiration Planning (2024)**

**Hardcoded software approach:**
"TCJA will expire December 31, 2025. Here's your plan assuming 2017 tax rates return."

**Problem:** That's not what happened. OBBBA passed instead. Your plan is wrong.

**Fatboy approach:**
Run three scenarios:
- Scenario A: TCJA expires as scheduled (25%, 28% brackets)
- Scenario B: TCJA extended permanently (22%, 24% brackets)
- Scenario C: Partial extension or modification (mix of rates)

Compare all three. See which strategies work in ALL scenarios. Make robust decisions that work regardless of what Congress does.

**When OBBBA actually passed:**
- Closest to Scenario B (permanent TCJA rates)
- But with additions (senior deduction)
- Easy to update Scenario B with senior deduction
- Strategies were already robust across scenarios

**This is how professional financial planners work.** They don't assume one future. They model multiple futures and find strategies that work across scenarios.

## The "Edit Your Own Tax Parameters" Advantage

**Five real situations where this mattered:**

### 1. TCJA Expiration Uncertainty (2024-2025)
Users modeled expiration vs extension. Made Roth conversion decisions robust to both outcomes.

### 2. OBBBA Senior Deduction (2025)
Users added $12,000 senior deduction for 2026-2028, removed it for 2029+. Saw the conversion timing advantage immediately.

### 3. State Tax Planning
User moving from California (13.3% top rate) to Florida (0% tax). Edited state tax rate by year. Saw exactly when to do Roth conversions.

### 4. IRMAA Bracket Management
User edited future IRMAA thresholds to account for inflation adjustments. Found conversion amounts that avoided future Medicare premium cliffs.

### 5. Conservative Tax Planning
User assumes tax rates will increase 20% by 2035 (deficit concerns). Edited brackets higher for future years. Stress-tested retirement plan against higher taxes.

**None of these are possible with hardcoded software.**

## "What If I Edit Something Wrong?"

**Valid concern. Three protections:**

### 1. Default to Current Law
Software ships with current 2026 OBBBA tax parameters. If you don't edit anything, you're using current law.

### 2. Reset to Defaults
One-click reset back to official current law parameters. Undo any edits instantly.

### 3. Scenario Comparison
Edit parameters in Scenario B while keeping Scenario A at defaults. Compare side-by-side. See the impact of your changes.

**The alternative is worse:**
Trusting a black box with hardcoded parameters you can't see, can't verify, and can't update when wrong.

At least with editable parameters, you control what you're modeling.

## The Tax Law Change Guarantee

**We guarantee tax law will change again.**

Maybe in 2027. Maybe 2028. Definitely before you retire.

**When it does:**

**Hardcoded software users:**
- Wait 6-18 months for vendor updates
- Plan with outdated numbers
- Make decisions based on wrong assumptions
- Hope the vendor eventually updates correctly

**Fatboy users:**
- Read our blog post explaining the changes (published within days)
- Update tax parameters yourself (takes 10 minutes)
- Run new scenarios immediately
- Make decisions based on current law

**This is why professional financial planners use software with editable parameters.**

They don't wait for vendor updates. They model the changes themselves.

## What About Other Features?

**Yes, Fatboy does everything else retirement software should do:**

✓ Monte Carlo simulations (sequence of returns risk)
✓ Roth conversion optimization
✓ IRMAA bracket analysis
✓ RMD calculations
✓ Social Security optimization
✓ Tax bracket management
✓ Withdrawal sequencing
✓ Scenario comparison

**But the editable tax parameters are what make all of those features actually useful.**

What good is a Roth conversion optimizer if it's using 2024 tax rates in 2027?

What good is IRMAA analysis if it's using outdated Medicare brackets?

What good is long-term planning if tax assumptions are frozen in time?

## The TCJA→OBBBA Case Study

**December 2024:**
Most retirement software: "TCJA expires in 12 months. Your taxes are going up 20-30%."

**Fatboy blog:** ["TCJA Expiration 2026: The Tax Bomb Nobody's Modeling"]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2025-01-14-TCJA-Tax-Expiration %})
Explained what expiration would mean. Showed users how to model it. Recommended hedging strategies.

**July 2025:**
OBBBA passes. TCJA made permanent. New senior deduction added (2026-2028).

Most retirement software: Obsolete. Wrong numbers. Waiting for updates.

**Fatboy blog:** ["OBBBA Changes Everything"]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2025-01-19-OBBBA-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill %})
Published within days. Explained new law. Showed exactly which parameters to update.

**Fatboy users:** Updated parameters. Modeling new law accurately within hours.

**This is the advantage of editable parameters + expert analysis.**

You're never stuck. You're never waiting. You're never planning with outdated numbers.

## "But I'm Not a Tax Expert"

**You don't need to be.**

You need to:
1. Read our blog posts (we explain the changes in plain English)
2. Follow the parameter update instructions
3. Run the scenarios we recommend

**Example: OBBBA Senior Deduction Update**

**Our blog post said:**
"Edit standard deduction for 2026-2028: Add $12,000 (married, both 65+). Set it back to regular standard deduction for 2029+. Then run Roth conversion scenarios for 2026-2028 vs 2029+ to see the tax savings."

**You do:**
- Open tax parameters
- Edit standard deduction 2026: $31,500 + $12,000 = $43,500
- Edit standard deduction 2027: $43,500 (with inflation)
- Edit standard deduction 2028: $43,500 (with inflation)
- Edit standard deduction 2029: $31,500 (senior deduction expired)
- Save
- Run scenarios

**Takes 5 minutes. You're now modeling current law accurately.**

Compare that to waiting 12 months for your vendor to maybe update their software.

## Who This Is For

**Fatboy Financial Planner is built for people who:**

✓ Want to control their own retirement planning
✓ Don't trust black box calculators
✓ Need to model tax law changes
✓ Value accuracy over simplicity
✓ Are willing to learn (but don't need a PhD)
✓ Want software that doesn't become obsolete every time Congress passes a bill

**This is NOT for people who:**

❌ Want a "set it and forget it" calculator
❌ Trust vendor updates to always be timely and correct
❌ Don't care about tax optimization
❌ Are satisfied with generic retirement advice

## The Bottom Line

**Tax laws changed in 2025. They'll change again in 2027 or 2028.**

**When they do, do you want to:**

**Option A:** Wait 6-18 months for your retirement software vendor to update? Plan with outdated numbers in the meantime? Hope they eventually get it right?

**Option B:** Update the parameters yourself in 10 minutes? Keep planning through the uncertainty? Model multiple scenarios to hedge against legislative risk?

**Fatboy is Option B.**

Because retirement planning with frozen tax assumptions isn't planning. It's hoping Congress never changes anything.

And the TCJA→OBBBA transition just proved that hope is not a strategy.
