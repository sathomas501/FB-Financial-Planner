# TCJA Expires December 31, 2025
## Is Your Retirement Plan Ready for Higher Tax Brackets?

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) sunsets at the end of 2025. Unless Congress acts:
- **Tax brackets increase** across the board (22% → 25%, 24% → 28%)
- **Standard deduction gets cut nearly in half** ($29,200 → ~$15,000 for married couples)
- **Personal exemptions may return** (complicating planning further)

Then OBBBA's senior deduction phases in (2026-2028), creating a **narrow window** where strategic planning can save six figures in lifetime taxes.

**Your retirement calculator needs to handle this transition. Most can't.**

## The 2025-2028 Tax Planning Window

### 2024-2025: The TCJA Window
**Current lower brackets are still in effect.**
- Roth conversions at 22% instead of 25%
- Lower marginal rates on retirement income
- Larger standard deduction shields more income

**Action:** Accelerate Roth conversions, realize capital gains, take bonuses - while brackets are low.

### 2026: TCJA Expires + OBBBA Year 1
**Tax brackets jump. OBBBA senior deduction begins (for those 65+).**
- Married couples lose ~$14,000 in standard deduction
- But seniors gain OBBBA deduction ($4,000 in 2026)
- Net effect: most retirees see tax increase

**Action:** Understand your new effective rate. Rebalance withdrawal strategy.

### 2027-2028: OBBBA Transition
**Senior deduction increases year by year.**
- 2027: $6,500 senior deduction
- 2028: Full $10,000 senior deduction
- Post-2028: Unknown (depends on future legislation)

**Action:** Optimize timing of income, conversions, and withdrawals around changing deductions.

---

## Why Most Retirement Calculators Will Fail You

**They have hardcoded 2024 tax brackets.**

When TCJA expires, their projections become obsolete overnight. You'll wait 6-18 months for a vendor update - if it ever comes.

**They can't model OBBBA.**

The senior deduction phases in over 3 years (2026-2028). Generic calculators have no way to handle this transition.

**They don't let you edit tax parameters.**

Tax laws will change again in 2027, 2028, 2030. You need software that adapts when Congress acts - not software that becomes a paperweight.

## How Fatboy Handles Tax Law Changes

### Editable Tax Parameters (Pro Feature)

**Federal Brackets:** Edit marginal rates, income thresholds, standard deduction amounts
**State Taxes:** Model your state's brackets (or compare states if you're planning a move)
**OBBBA Senior Deduction:** Built-in support for the 2026-2028 phase-in schedule
**Future Changes:** When tax laws change in 2027-2028, you update the software yourself in 10 minutes

**You're not dependent on a vendor.** You control the assumptions.

### Side-by-Side Scenario Comparison

Run the same retirement plan under different tax regimes:
- **Scenario A:** TCJA remains permanent (baseline)
- **Scenario B:** TCJA expires as scheduled (current law)
- **Scenario C:** Partial TCJA extension (compromise scenario)
- **Scenario D:** Your own assumption based on political landscape

See exactly how each scenario impacts your:
- After-tax retirement income
- Roth conversion strategy
- Withdrawal sequencing
- Total lifetime taxes paid

### Year-by-Year Tax Projections

Fatboy doesn't just give you a "probability of success" number. It shows:
- Your effective tax rate every single year from now to age 95
- Federal and state taxes owed each year
- How TCJA expiration + OBBBA phase-in changes your rate
- Exactly where you land in the brackets (22% vs 24% vs 25% matters)

## Real Tax Transition Scenarios

**Scenario 1: The Front-Load Strategy**
*Convert $200k to Roth in 2024-2025 at 22-24% brackets, before expiration pushes you to 25-28% brackets*

**Scenario 2: The OBBBA Optimization**
*Model retirement at 64 vs 65 vs 66 to maximize senior deduction availability during the transition years*

**Scenario 3: The State Tax Arbitrage**
*Compare retiring in California (9.3% state tax) vs Texas (0%) vs Florida (0%) under post-TCJA federal rates*

**Scenario 4: The Withdrawal Sequencing Shift**
*Withdraw from taxable accounts in 2024-2025, then switch to Roth after TCJA expires to minimize lifetime taxes*

**Scenario 5: The "What If Congress Extends TCJA" Hedge**
*Build two plans: one assuming expiration, one assuming extension. Stress test both.*
