# Professional Retirement Planning Without the 1% AUM Fee
## You Don't Need a Financial Advisor. You Need Their Tools.

You've built a seven-figure portfolio. You understand asset allocation, tax-loss harvesting, and why IRMAA thresholds matter. You don't need someone to explain dollar-cost averaging or sell you a target-date fund.

**What you need:** The same modeling tools advisors use - without paying 1% of AUM forever.

**What you get:** Desktop software that handles Roth conversions, TCJA expiration impacts, IRMAA optimization, withdrawal sequencing, and Monte Carlo stress testing. One-time purchase. You own it.

---

## The 1% AUM Problem

### Do the Math:

**$1,000,000 portfolio × 1% AUM = $10,000 per year**

- Year 1: $10,000
- Year 5: $50,000+ (compounding portfolio growth)
- Year 10: $100,000+
- Year 20: $200,000+
- **Retirement lifetime (30 years): $300,000 - $500,000**

**Half a million dollars.** For what?

- Quarterly rebalancing? You can do that yourself.
- Annual Roth conversion analysis? Software can model it.
- Tax planning? You (or your $300/hour CPA) can handle it.
- Generic financial plan PDF? You need software, not a service.

## What Advisors Actually Use (That You Can Own)

Advisors don't have magic. They have **software** and **frameworks**.

**Software:** Planning tools that model retirement scenarios, tax strategies, and risk analysis
**Frameworks:** Methodologies for withdrawal strategies, asset location, and tax optimization

**You can get the software. You already understand the frameworks.**

### Fatboy Gives You Advisor-Level Tools:

✅ **Monte Carlo Simulations** - Stress test your plan across thousands of market scenarios
✅ **Roth Conversion Modeling** - Year-by-year tax impact analysis with IRMAA considerations
✅ **Tax Optimization** - Editable federal/state brackets, TCJA modeling, OBBBA planning
✅ **Withdrawal Sequencing** - Optimize which accounts to tap when for minimum lifetime taxes
✅ **Breakpoint Analysis** (Pro) - Find exactly where your plan fails under stress
✅ **Professional Reports** (Pro) - Generate advisor-quality PDFs for your records or CPA review

**Advisors charge $10,000/year for access to these tools. You pay $149 once.**

---

## When You DON'T Need an Advisor

You probably don't need an advisor if you:

✅ Understand the difference between Roth and Traditional accounts
✅ Know your risk tolerance and can stick to an allocation through downturns
✅ Can rebalance your portfolio annually without hand-holding
✅ Understand tax brackets and how Roth conversions work
✅ Want to make your own financial decisions (not outsource them)
✅ Are comfortable using desktop software to model scenarios

**If you checked most of these boxes, you don't need a $10,000/year service. You need a $149 tool.**

---

## When You MIGHT Need an Advisor

Consider hiring an advisor if you:

❌ Don't understand investing basics and need education
❌ Can't stick to a plan during market crashes without someone to talk you off the ledge
❌ Have complex estate planning needs (trusts, gifting strategies, business succession)
❌ Want someone else to make all financial decisions for you
❌ Have behavioral issues with money (overspending, gambling on individual stocks, panic selling)

**Be honest with yourself.** Most people with seven-figure portfolios don't need these services.

---

## The Hybrid Approach: Software + Hourly CPA

**Instead of:** $10,000/year to an AUM advisor forever

**Consider:**
- **Fatboy Pro:** $149 one-time for planning software
- **Hourly CPA:** $300-500 for annual tax strategy review
- **Total year 1:** ~$500-650
- **Total ongoing:** $300-500/year for CPA consultation

**Savings vs 1% AUM advisor:** $9,500/year → $285,000 over 30 years

You model the scenarios in Fatboy. Your CPA reviews the tax strategy once a year. You make the decisions.

---

## What Sophisticated Planners Actually Need

You don't need someone to pick your investments. You need software that can model:

### 1. Roth Conversion Strategies
- How much to convert each year without spiking IRMAA brackets
- TCJA expiration impact on optimal conversion timing (2026)
- State tax considerations if you're planning a move
- RMD minimization through strategic conversions

### 2. Withdrawal Sequencing
- Which accounts to tap when (taxable vs tax-deferred vs Roth)
- Capital gains harvesting vs ordinary income withdrawals
- Social Security timing optimization (62 vs 67 vs 70)
- Pension vs lump sum analysis

### 3. Tax Optimization Across Decades
- Bracket management year-by-year through retirement
- IRMAA threshold optimization (avoid $2,000+ premium surcharges)
- State tax planning (retire in TX/FL/NV vs high-tax states)
- RMD impact at 75+ (and strategies to minimize)

### 4. Risk Analysis & Stress Testing
- Monte Carlo simulations: What if you retire into a bear market?
- Sequence of returns risk modeling (the "retirement red zone")
- Breakpoint analysis: Where does your plan actually fail?
- Sensitivity testing: Which assumptions matter most?

**Fatboy does all of this.** No advisor required.

## Real Scenarios Fatboy Handles (That Advisors Charge For)

**Scenario 1: The Early Retirement Question**
*Retire at 62 vs 65 vs 67. Model the cash flow, tax impact, and Social Security tradeoffs. See exactly what you give up by retiring early.*

**Scenario 2: The Roth Conversion Ladder**
*Retire at 58, live on taxable accounts, convert $60k/year to Roth at low brackets until Social Security + RMDs start. Full tax impact analysis.*

**Scenario 3: The State Tax Arbitrage**
*Compare retiring in California (9.3% state tax + estate tax) vs Texas (0% + 0%) vs Florida (0% + 0%). Lifetime tax savings: $200k+*

**Scenario 4: The "One More Year" Analysis**
*Work one more year, save $80k more, delay Social Security. Is it worth it? Model the breakeven vs retiring now.*

**Scenario 5: The Mortgage Payoff Debate**
*Pay off $300k mortgage at 3.5% vs invest the cash at expected 7% returns. Factor in tax deductions, sequence risk, and peace of mind.*

**Advisors charge $10,000/year to run these scenarios. Fatboy does it for $149 once.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can this really replace a financial advisor?**
A: For sophisticated investors who understand financial planning basics - yes. If you need hand-holding or behavioral coaching, probably not.

**Q: What if I have questions about my specific situation?**
A: Hire a fee-only CFP for a one-time consultation ($1,500-3,000). Get your questions answered. Use Fatboy for ongoing modeling. Still cheaper than one year of AUM fees.

**Q: Does this pick my investments?**
A: No. This is planning software, not portfolio management. You decide your asset allocation. Fatboy models the outcomes.

**Q: Can I generate reports to share with my CPA?**
A: Yes. Pro version creates professional PDF reports with full projections. Email them to your CPA for tax strategy review.

**Q: What if I screw something up without an advisor watching?**
A: Fatboy shows you the tradeoffs and risks. You can run "what if I'm wrong" scenarios. Stress test your assumptions. Most mistakes people make are behavioral (panic selling), not modeling errors.

**Q: Do I get support?**
A: Email support for technical issues. We can't give you financial advice (not advisors), but we'll help you use the software effectively.
