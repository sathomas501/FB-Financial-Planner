# Retirement Planning Blog

**Deep dives into the complex questions that actually matter.** No stock photos of beaches. No "10 tips for a happy retirement" listicles. Just rigorous financial planning analysis for professionals planning multi-decade futures.

Topics we cover: tax optimization, withdrawal sequencing, sequence-of-returns risk, Roth conversions, IRMAA management, Monte Carlo simulations, OBBBA planning, and the entire set of retirement questions generic calculators dodge.

## Why This Blog Exists

Most retirement planning content lands in one of two buckets:

**Oversimplified advice.** "Save 15% of your income!" "Rule of thumb: 4% withdrawal rate!" - advice that assumes everyone has the same situation.

**Needlessly academic research.** PhD-level math with Greek letters, but no practical takeaway.

This blog lives between those extremes: technical depth without jargon, real scenarios with clear takeaways, and the math behind every recommendation.
