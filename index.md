# Professional-Grade Retirement Planning Software
## For People Who Don't Need a Financial Advisor

You've built a seven-figure portfolio. You understand tax brackets, sequence of returns risk, and why IRMAA matters. You don't need someone to explain dollar-cost averaging or sell you a target-date fund.

**What you need:** The same modeling tools advisors use - without the 1% AUM fee or the simplified "consumer software" that treats you like you're financially illiterate.

**What you get:** Desktop software that models the complex scenarios that actually matter to your retirement. Roth conversion ladders. TCJA expiration impacts. IRMAA threshold management. Withdrawal sequencing across account types. 

Your data never leaves your computer. You own the software. One price. No subscriptions.

<h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #0066cc;">Tax Laws Changed in 2025. Your Calculator Shouldn't Be Stuck in 2024.</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The TCJA→OBBBA transition just proved why <strong>editable tax parameters</strong> matter. When OBBBA passed in July 2025, most retirement software became obsolete overnight. Fatboy users updated their tax parameters in 10 minutes and kept planning.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Tax laws will change again.</strong> Probably in 2027-2028. When they do, you'll be ready. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/why-fatboy" style="color: #0066cc; font-weight: 600;">Read why this matters →</a></p>

## Why Sophisticated Planners Choose Fatboy

### Tax Modeling That Doesn't Insult Your Intelligence

Model OBBBA senior deduction strategies (2026-2028). Edit federal and state tax parameters yourself. See exactly how a $50k Roth conversion impacts your taxes this year, your IRMAA brackets at 65, and your RMDs at 75. Compare strategies side-by-side with full tax implications flowing through every projection.

**This isn't a calculator with hardcoded 2024 tax brackets.** It's a modeling engine you control. When tax laws change, you update the parameters yourself - no waiting 6-18 months for vendor updates.

### "What If" Analysis That Actually Works

- Retire at 62 vs 65 vs 67 - full cash flow impact
- Roth conversion strategies year-by-year
- Pay off mortgage early vs invest the difference  
- Semi-retirement with part-time income
- Healthcare costs before Medicare
- Different spending levels (lean / baseline / comfortable)

Every scenario change propagates through taxes, account balances, Social Security timing, and long-term outcomes. **You can see the tradeoffs, not just a "probability of success" number.**

### Find Your Plan's Breaking Points (Pro Feature)

Stop wondering "am I being too conservative?" or "is this sustainable?"

**Breakpoint Analysis** tells you exactly where your plan fails:
- How low can returns go before you run out of money?
- What's the maximum safe withdrawal rate for YOUR portfolio?
- Which assumptions actually matter vs which are just noise?

Interactive stress testing with color-coded risk zones. Sensitivity analysis that separates real risks from worries.

### Monte Carlo Simulations Built for Planners

Not the dumbed-down version. Full control over:
- Asset allocation by account type
- Volatility assumptions
- Return sequences
- Number of iterations
- Risk-free rate assumptions

Run Monte Carlo against any of your scenarios and compare results side-by-side. Enhanced results dashboard breaks down the full distribution of outcomes - percentile bands, success rates by time period, and tail-risk exposure - so you can see not just whether your plan survives, but by how much.

### Estate & Legacy Planning

See the full picture - not just whether you'll run out of money, but what you'll leave behind.

- **Estate value projections** - See how your estate grows or draws down year-by-year through retirement and into legacy
- **Legacy goal tracking** - Set a target bequest and see whether your plan meets it
- **Beneficiary & inheritance analysis** - See what heirs will receive, including inherited IRA RMD implications under current rules
- **Estate tax exposure** - Track your estate against federal exemption thresholds, including TCJA exemption sunset scenarios

Estate planning isn't just for the ultra-wealthy. If you have a seven-figure portfolio, a paid-off house, and IRAs with RMD obligations, your heirs have an inheritance tax problem whether you've planned for it or not.

## Pricing That Makes Sense

**Free Version:** Full planning capability. 3 scenarios. Core features unlocked. This isn't a trial - it's genuinely useful software.

**Pro Version - $149 (One-Time):**
- Unlimited scenarios
- Breakpoint analysis & stress testing
- Professional PDF reports
- Advanced Monte Carlo controls with enhanced results dashboard
- Sensitivity analysis
- Estate & legacy forecasting (estate value projections, legacy goals, estate tax analysis)
- All future updates included

**No subscriptions. No annual "update" fees. You own it.**

Compare that to advisor fees (1% of $1M = $10,000/year) or subscription software ($20-50/month forever). This pays for itself immediately.
