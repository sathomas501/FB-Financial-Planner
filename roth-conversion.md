# Roth Conversion Planning Software
## Model Tax Impact Year-by-Year. No Spreadsheets Required.

You know a Roth conversion ladder makes sense for your situation. You understand the tax arbitrage. What you need is software that can model the full impact: federal taxes this year, IRMAA brackets at 65, RMD reductions at 75, and long-term account balances.

**Stop using spreadsheets that can't handle the complexity.**

## Why Roth Conversions Matter (And Why Most Calculators Miss the Boat)

The 2026 TCJA expiration creates a **3-year window** (2024-2026) where Roth conversions are significantly more valuable:
- Lower tax brackets expire December 31, 2025
- Standard deduction gets cut nearly in half
- OBBBA senior deduction (2026-2028) creates additional planning complexity

**If you're planning conversions for 2025-2028, your calculator needs to handle both TCJA expiration AND OBBBA.** Most don't.

## What Fatboy Models (That Generic Calculators Can't)

### Full Multi-Year Conversion Analysis
- Model conversion amounts year-by-year from now through retirement
- See exactly how a $50k conversion in 2025 impacts:
  - Your 2025 federal and state tax bill
  - Your IRMAA brackets when you hit Medicare
  - Your RMDs starting at 75
  - Your total after-tax wealth at 90

### IRMAA Threshold Management
Medicare premiums jump at specific income thresholds (IRMAA brackets). A poorly timed $5k conversion can cost you $2,000+ in extra premiums.

**Fatboy shows IRMAA impacts for every conversion scenario** - so you can stay under thresholds or deliberately breach them when it makes sense.

### Tax Law Flexibility You Control
TCJA expires. OBBBA phases in. Tax laws will change again in 2027-2028.

**You can edit tax brackets yourself.** When Congress changes the rules, you update the parameters in 10 minutes and keep planning. No waiting 6-18 months for vendor updates.

### Compare Strategies Side-by-Side
- Convert $40k/year for 5 years vs $100k in one big year
- Front-load conversions before TCJA expires vs spread evenly
- Roth conversions vs paying off mortgage early
- Different conversion amounts by tax bracket

See the tradeoffs. Understand the risks. Make informed decisions.

## Real Roth Conversion Scenarios Fatboy Handles

**Scenario 1: The TCJA Window (2024-2026)**
*Convert while brackets are low, before expiration drives your rate from 22% to 25%*

**Scenario 2: The Early Retirement Conversion Ladder**
*Retire at 55, live on taxable accounts, convert $50k/year at 12% bracket until Social Security starts*

**Scenario 3: The IRMAA Optimization**
*Convert exactly up to IRMAA thresholds, maximize conversions without triggering premium surcharges*

**Scenario 4: The Mega Conversion Year**
*One spouse retires, other still working, income drops - convert aggressively in the low-income year*

**Scenario 5: The RMD Minimization Strategy**
*Convert enough pre-tax to Roth so your RMDs at 75 don't push you into higher brackets or trigger IRMAA*

## How It Works

**1. Enter Your Accounts**
Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, 401(k), taxable brokerage. Current balances and contribution plans.

**2. Model Conversion Strategy**
Choose conversion amounts by year. Or let Fatboy suggest optimal amounts based on staying under specific tax brackets.

**3. See Full Tax Impact**
Federal taxes, state taxes, IRMAA brackets, RMD projections. Every year from now through age 95.

**4. Compare Alternatives**
Run multiple scenarios. Convert $30k vs $60k per year. Start now vs wait until retirement. See exactly what changes.

**5. Stress Test**
Monte Carlo simulations show how conversions perform across thousands of market scenarios. Does your plan survive a 2008-style crash right after conversion?

## Frequently Asked Questions

A: Yes. You can edit federal tax brackets yourself to model TCJA expiration, and the OBBBA senior deduction parameters are editable in Pro.

A: Yes. Fatboy calculates IRMAA brackets based on MAGI and shows premium surcharges for every year you're on Medicare.

**Q: Can I model state taxes?**
A: Yes. State tax brackets are fully editable. Model California's 9.3% vs Texas's 0% vs your state's actual rates.

**Q: What if tax laws change again after I buy it?**
A: You update the tax parameters yourself in the software. Takes 10 minutes. No waiting for vendors. This is why editable tax parameters matter.
